#Task 1: Use math operators to solve the set of tasks below
# [ ] print the result of subtracting 15 from 43
print(15-43)
# [ ] print the result of multiplying 15 and 43
print(15*43)
# [ ] print the result of dividing 156 by 12
print(156/12)
# [ ] print the result of dividing 21 by 0.5
print(21/0.5)
# [ ] print the result of adding 111 plus 84 and then subtracting 45
print(111+84-45)
# [ ] print the result of adding 21 and 4 and then multiplying that sum by 4

#Using input ask user how many units they want:
