#Sum of Rows
#Write a program to display the sum of all the numbers

#Counting Characters

#[2]Write a program to prompt the user for an odd positive number (help: x%2==1 and x>0; 
#no loop needed, If user inputs a positive odd number print “Correct” if they didn’t print “Incorrect”
userinput = int(input("Enter an odd positive number: "))
